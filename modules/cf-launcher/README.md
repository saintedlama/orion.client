# cf-launcher #
A harness for your [Cloud Foundry](http://cloudfoundry.org/) application that makes debugging a bit easier. cf-launcher wraps a simple
web UI around your app, adding a [visual debugger](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector), and the ability to kill or restart
your app right from the web, no CF commands necessary.

The launcher UI takes over a single URL prefix in your application's URL space: `/launcher`. If your app needs `/launcher`, you can
set the prefix to something else.


## Installation ##
1. **Install** cf-launcher as a dependency in your app:

   ```shell
   $ npm install --save cf-launcher
   ```

2. **Change your app's start command** to run `node_modules/.bin/launcher`.
   This is usually done by editing your app's `manifest.yml`. For example, if your `manifest.yml` has this command:

   ```
   start: node server.js
   ```

   You would change it to this:

   ```
   start: node_modules/.bin/launcher -- node server.js
   ```

3. **Set a password**.
   This step is crucial, as it prevents random web users from accessing your app's internals through cf-launcher. 

   The password can be provided as a command-line option (again, in your manifest.yml):

   ```
   start: node_modules/.bin/launcher --password secretPassw0rd -- node server.js
   ```

   Or you can set an environment variable named `LAUNCHER_PASSWORD` in your application environment. This is usually
   done using the CF [`set-env`](http://docs.run.pivotal.io/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#cli) command:

   ```shell
   $ cf set-env myapp LAUNCHER_PASSWORD  secretPassw0rd
   ```

   The command-line argument takes priority over the environment variable if both are set. If you don't provide a password,
   cf-launcher refuses to run.

4. **Deploy** your app.

5. **Visit** `https://your_application_url/launcher`. You'll see the launcher login page. Log in with the password
   you provided earlier, and you're all set.


## Usage

	cf-launcher [options] -- [COMMAND]

Where `COMMAND` is the command you usually use to start your app (for example, `node myapp.js`).

The supported `[options]` are:

#### `--password=secret`
Required. Gives the password used to log in to cf-launcher.
####  `--urlprefix=prefix`
Optional. Gives the URL prefix reserved by cf-launcher. Defaults to `urlprefix=/launcher`.


## Uninstallation ##
When your app is ready for production, you should uninstall cf-launcher.

1. Remove cf-launcher from your app's dependencies:

   ```shell
   $ npm uninstall --save cf-launcher
   ```

2. Restore your application's original start command.
